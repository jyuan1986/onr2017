Scripts for machine learning at ONR project (2017-)

Prerequisites:
Python 2,Numpy and Sklearn Packages

Data:
unnorma.input.data contains four columns, which are Temperature, Concentration, Dwelling Time and %Mass Change. 
norm.input.data contains four columns after normalization, consistent with unnorma.input.data. 

Machine Learning:
Four machine learning models are explored based on 19 bulk sample results. The target property is %Mass Change and they're normalized before the machine learning process. 
1. Multivariate Linear Regression
2. Support Vector Regression
3. Kernel Ridge Regression
4. Neural Network
