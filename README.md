Scripts for machine learning at ONR project (2017-)
Four machine learning models are explored based on 19 bulk sample results. The target property is %Mass Change and they're normalized before the machine learning process. 
1. Multivariate Linear Regression
2. Support Vector Regression
3. Kernel Ridge Regression
4. Neural Network
